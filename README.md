# CRISPR-Cas9 gRNA Specificity Analyzer ðŸ”¬ðŸ§¬
## A functional Python bioinformatics tool for analyzing and ranking CRISPR guide RNAs (gRNAs) based on off-target specificity using NCBI BLAST
This project was created to help students evaluate the specificity of CRISPR-Cas9 gRNAs by automating off-target analysis through BLAST, then scoring and ranking the results with customizable logic.

## How to run this Python gRNA analyzer

1. Clone this repo:
`git clone https://github.com/MisplacedOrange/crispr-grna-analyzer.git`
`cd crispr-grna-analyzer`
2. Install dependencies:
`pip install biopython numpy`
Make sure AchillesCommonEssentialControls.csv is in the same folder.
3. Run the script!
